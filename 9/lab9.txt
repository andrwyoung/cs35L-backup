since we want a minimal patch, 
we don't care about the differences in the comments
thus these next few steps will revert changes in 
commented code. thus the only things in the patch
will change the code that actually matters

removed the changed from the non .c files
using the given command
$ emacs <file in question>
C-x v =
undid all the changes and entered 'yes'
C-x v u
exited 
C-x C-c

removed the changes from the .c files more carefully
using the given command
$ emacs <file in questions>
C-x v =

then hovered over the diffs that were comments
and undid the changes using
C-u C-c C-a
which is the opposite of C-c C-a which applies changes
then exited
C-x C-x



$ ls src/*.c.rej	
	src/diff3.c.rej  src/diff.c.rej
there are 2 more files to edit. so manually changed them
$ vim src/diff3.c
$ vim src/diff.c

checked status to see which files where modified
$ git status
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c
nice. since it matched the spec
also checked git diff
$ git diff | wc
	190    1072    7503
so nice. matches spec

removed untracked files
$ git clean -f

make the diff file
$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt



looked at README-hacking
$ ./bootstrap

darn. I'm on lnxsrv09, so I have to apply additional patch 
copied patch into file
$ vim patch_file
$ patch -p0 < patch_file

$ ./configure
$ make 
$ make check

checked that it worked:
$ ./src/diff . - | grep \`
$ ./src/diff --help \ grep \`
showing that it worked. since all the backticks have been replaced




committed first
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "changed back-ticks to quotes"

also to make sure it worked, do another check
first got the original code
$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils-3.0
then copied my new patched source code into a new directory
$ cp -r diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch
ran the code given on the spec
$ diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt

then checked just to make sure they are the same
$ diff quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
they differ by a few bytes, but it's not inncuous because they're just the changed from ` to '
