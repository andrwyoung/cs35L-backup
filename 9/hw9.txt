forgot to delete quote-3.0-patch.txt
so deleted it and committed again
$ rm quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ git add quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ git commit -m "forgot to delete quote-3.0-patch.txt"



generated patch
$ git format-patch  -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt





doing partner's now
$ git checkout -b partner 'v3.0' 
$ git am < ../justin-patch.txt
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

checking if it works now:
$ ./src/diff . - | grep \`
$ ./src/diff --help \ grep \`
yes. partner's worked

$ make distdir
yep Changelog works





to do the last part, I logged out of Seasnet
then logged back in with -Y option
$ ssh -Y classkwz@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk

then waited for the window to open up
then found an old one and took a screenshot
