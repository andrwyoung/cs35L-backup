downloaded copies of the coreutils, 
the coreutils.sig and the GNU ring using wget

validated signature of coreutils.sig using
$ gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

warning showed up, because I didn't have the correct key

unzipped coreutils using 
$ tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

went into folder
$ cd coreutils-8.29

configured makefile with directory path
$ ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classkwz/Desktop/lab3/coreutils

made and make installed the file 
$ make && make install

created the patch file by copy and pasting patch into file
$ vim patch_file

patched the file 
$ patch -p0 < patch_file
entered in src/ls.c

made file again
$ make 
commands:
CC 	src/ls.o   :compile ls.o	
CCLD 	src/dir	   :links stuff to dir
CCLD	src/ls	   :links stuff to ls
CCLD	src/vdir   :links stuff to vdir
GEN	man/dir.1  :generate new man page for dir
GEN	man/ls.1   :generate new man page for ls
GEN	man/vdir.1 :generate new man page for vdir

tested that it worked 
$ ./src/ls -aA
it worked, and didn't print out . or ..


Q1) It's faster because the patch file shows that 
an if statement was removed, therefore there's 
less machine code so it's faster

Q2) By introducing this patch, programs that read 
file using ls -aA have to be changed to account 
for the 2 missing lines
