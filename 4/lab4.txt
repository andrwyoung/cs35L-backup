gives an error
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'

created patch file by copy and pasting patch into file
$ vim patch_file

patched the file
$ patch -p0 < patch_file

tried it again
$ make install

worked! failed because two of the functions were named the same
patch fixed this problem by renamed futimens to coreutils_futimens

checked the bug

bug works

$ gdb ./src/ls $tmp
(gdb) info functions
to look around for good functions too set breakpoints at
the first pageful of functions show there's a function called 
static int compare_mtime(V, V);

(gdb) b compare_mtime
(gdb) run -lt --full-time

used
(gdb) s
(gdb) list
to get the next few answers

discovered that our function returns 
cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll)

stepping into cmp_mtime function
found out that it calls timespec_cmp
stepping further into the functions shows that 
timespec_cmp is returning the difference between
the differences in seconds for both

timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
{
	int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
	return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
}

this may be a problem because subtracting a large number
or large negative number may overflow and become a very large number
(which was probably why the wwi-armistice was listed first)

let's create the diff file to change timespec_cmp
timespec_cmp is declared in timespec.h
$ cp lib/timespec.h timespec.h

changed timespec_cmp to return
a.tv_nsec > b.tv_nsec ? 1 : a.tv_nsec < b.tv_nsec ? -1 : 0;
so that it doesn't use any subtraction and can't overflow

create the patch file
$ diff -u lib/timespec.h timespec.h > lab4.diff
changed timespec.h to lib/timespec.h so filepath is correct
and added:
* timespec_cmp made sure it doesn't overflow
by replacing it with code that doesn't subtract

applied the patch 
$ patch -p0 < lab4.diff

tested it
$ make && make install
$ ./cores/bin/ls -lt --full-time $tmp
-rw-r--r-- 1 classkwz class 0 2018-11-04 14:12:09.524822229 -0800 now1

-rw-r--r-- 1 classkwz class 0 1918-11-11 03:00:00.000000000 -0800 wwi-armistice
yay! it works!

checking SEASEnet servers now
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice

Looks like it thinks it's from the future
