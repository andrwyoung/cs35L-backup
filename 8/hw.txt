1) Yes. The network is still secure because the bytes are all encrypted anyways
and they would have no way of knowing what the messages sent were unless they had
the private key (which hopefully they don't)

But if they were to record keystrokes, then they could just steal my password
and they can obtain my private key. And they would know what I'm sending to Justin
through my Beaglebone (if they even care).

Also if I was booting off a USB, and they have control of the USB, then they have
everything, since they could just take the private (and public) keys kept in .ssh

2) gpg --verify doesn't verify that I created the file since it only checks if
the signature matches the file in question. So it doesn't protect form people tampering
with the files

the best method to verifying a PGP key is to establish a "chain of trust" between you
and the key owner. This can be through a trusted third party source validating that 
the file was indeed from me, or through testimony of other people.

If not. some other solutions are to find out more about the key by looking at
who signed it or try to look for a reliable source confirming the key. If nothing else
works, you can also ask the signer to confirm the key's fingerprint
